# MUA3220 Final Report

Hello, again. It's that time of the semester, once more. Like I said in the last essay, this module didn't clash with the CS one I took this semester, so I'm really glad to be here for the second time. This time, the music we learnt was Balinese Gamelan and Malay music, both of which I've tried a little bit during the GEH and GES modules, aka the shallow end of the pool.

Apart from those two 3-week tutorials, my other music making experience includes Carnatic singing, Western piano, and recording Youtube covers in my bedroom. I've recently gotten into making music on Garageband because the songs I started liking and wanting to cover didn't have backing tracks, so it was time to make them myself. Also I should definitely count last semester's djembe and mbira learning, they absolutely have changed the way I think about rhythms and music.

<Quick tangent about last semester's classes because this thing happened after the essay was due: I was waiting at the MRT station for a friend, and it was pretty empty, so the only sound around was the clacking of the escalator, and I was bored. So naturally, being freshly graduated from a semester of drum lessons, I started bouncing my knee on-beat, and then off-beat to the escalator, and amused myself for quite a bit of time that way>

I didn't really have any concerns about the Balinese gamelan, because I knew that it was going to be fun and difficult, and we would learn, eventually. I was a little apprehensive about the Malay music portion of the semester, because I did scroll through your youtube page and saw a previous semester's malay music final performance. Everyone was playing their own instruments and doing it like the experts that they were, and well, I don't play an instrument, so that was pretty scary. And then it turned out we were going to be doing kompang all semester, so I guess I worried for nothing. Being a repeat customer, I more or less knew what to expect in terms of difficulty, although I Definitely Did Not Expect the final performance to be live in front of an audience of real actual people. I have performed music in front of an audience before, and I've even done it alone, so most it wasn't too scary, although there were definitely parts that were terrifying.

On Tuesday of week 1, i.e. the first day of class, you were reading out everybody's names so that we could know each other, and you read out a name that sort of gently poked at my memory, jogged is a very strong word for that. So I looked across the row and then it finally clicked: I'd met Jun Rong before at a different music module that we both took, except not in person, just over zoom. I remember trying to explain some code that I'd written, and I was clearly not doing a very good job, using far too much jargon. I have never seen someone look this terrified of me. I immediately started over, to attempt a better explanation. So that was nice, I was starting the semester with 2 friends pre-prepared.

Probably the first and most formidable main challenge of the semester was getting the slap sound on the kompang. All of us got the low sound, the lentung pretty much immediately, but for the slap, cerang, our initial attempts were absolutely pitiful. None of us were really understanding how to get the sound, and power/volume was not sufficient to get it. I think by the end of the first lesson, we were about halfway to a cerang sound, and also very sore. We did also promptly lose all of that progress by the second lesson and had to rebuild, but eventually we managed to get the sound without backsliding. 

The next challenge was just the limitations of my physical strength. For such a small, flat little drum, the kompang is surprisingly heavy. I know I bragged about getting stronger from playing Djembe and even accidentally snapped a wooden pole in half last semester, but I sure didn't keep any of that strength...

By the end of that first lesson, my left shoulder, arm, and fingers were aching badly, and my
right palm was similarly very sore from hitting the drum.
I had a bright idea: If playing Djembe made me stronger and better at the gym, then perhaps
the reverse was also true? If I worked harder at the gym I would be able to lift the kompang much more easily? Spoiler alert: the answer is yes. Next morning, I spent extra time at the exercise corner thing downstairs near my flat, and started increasing the amount of resistance on those machines too. And obviously, I had to brag about it, because "pics or it didn't happen".

I definitely started having a much better time in kompang lessons as long as I kept up with my workout routine. The second lesson, my fingers and wrist weren't screaming, only my shoulder was complaining a bit, and even that subsided over the semester and I'm very proud of the fact that in the final performance I was holding the kompang perfectly vertical and it wasn't moving while I hit it. At one point late in the semester, my mum grabbed my left hand and then was very confused as to why it was so small; looks like my left hand got thinner due to the death grip I had on the drum.

We did have scores for kompang, but I am Jared 19* so I needed Syaf to play the rhythm for me to copy. 

*Here is the explanation for the reference

For kompang, the rhythms are composed in a way that it is split into parts. Each part is different and they interlock together to form the actual rhythm. I played the Selang part (off-beat) for all three pieces that we learnt. 

We learnt each section and also practiced the full piece with Syaf giving us visual signals for transitions, in kompang melayu, the processional piece. Unlike djembe, which had auditory signals, kompang only has visual signals that include raising the kompang, extending it flat and raising it slanted. So this meant that whoever is leading or signalling the group, i.e. the Khalifa, needed to have a kompang. This became a bit of an issue in the first few weeks, when somehow, there weren't quite enough kompangs to go around, so I lent Syaf my notepad as a substitute, and made this meme:

![photo_2022-04-18 20 37 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13196618/164414308-133783f5-1d48-4ffc-87e9-2f1d89981be8.jpeg)

Then when Syaf asked who would like to be the khalifa, I was in a bit of a powerful mood, because I was wearing a skirt that had pockets, so I volunteered. Turns out, leading the piece involves a whole lot of extra information that nobody else got, but somehow intuitively were able to follow. That part is pretty fascinating. Like, to begin, I have to raise, then drop the kompang and then everybody plays the first two notes together. And the reason why we were able to catch the tempo and the exact moment those 2 notes had to be played, was because the raising and dropping were two counts and the first 2 actual notes were 3 and 4. That was pretty cool to find out. 

And this was me the week after volunteering for khalifa:

I have to admit, the power of the khalifa really went to my head, especially in the final performance. The entire class? Looking at me? Making the building rattle with that kind of volume? On MY orders? That was a power trip, and I'm not sure I can be blamed for it.

Kashyfi's silat performance is such an absolute beauty to watch in the video from the audience perspective, especially when he uses the entire space available and comes so close to the camera. Pretty awesome of him to show up just for this.

The second piece we learnt was one that Syaf had composed, called Sound the Rebana. This one was really fun, it had CHOREOGRAPHY! Although we definitely kept having the awkward shuffle as we figured out which way to sidestep, still the most fun to perform. 
behold, the awkward shuffle in all its glory:

Closer to the end of the piece I started having difficulties with holding on to the drum securely due to the choreography, so I hooked my thumb over to the skin part for a better grip. Probably people with larger hands had an advantage there. Janice was dying with her tiny hands, she just couldnt do the final section of choreography with the extending forward twice and then raising it vertically up. But that ending choreography is my absolute favourite, it looked so EPIC

The last kompang piece was juru pencar, combined with Balinese Gamelan, and in this piece, only Jun Rong and I were playing Selang, because the other two members of the Selang part were Enqi, on gong, and Na Hyun, on trompong, so they didn't play kompang. Cut to me and Jun Rong frantically practicing our best telepathy skills:

![photo_2022-04-21 16 28 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13196618/164413581-4936ba97-0402-4f49-a693-c817b1960fd5.jpeg)

The third challenge was for the Friday lessons, but not strictly related to Balinese Gamelan. I have a lesson right before this class, and in week 1, I ended up underestimating the travel time needed, and turned up 20 minutes late to class because the buses decided to betray me on that day. My solution: I just decided to leave my previous class early, so that I had enough time to walk and take a bus and walk some more, so I didn't show up late for the rest of the semester.

For the first piece, tabuh kompyang, I played jegog, which is one of the lower pitched instruments. Initially I was playing one of the pair and Chris was playing the other, but he moved to trompong to play the melody, and therefore I got to pull double duty. At first it was really disorienting to look back and forth at both instruments, but I eventually got the muscle memory working for me. The way the two instruments were tuned just a few Hertz off from each other to create the beats was really cool, and I really enjoyed sitting in the V shape in between both instruments to really get the best impact of the beats. 

And obviously, Thomas was having the time of his life playing the kethuk, which is clearly the best job. This resulted in many, many jokes in the group chat about our esteemed star player, who was a good sport about it all

<img width="374" alt="thomasKethuk" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13196618/164413991-ff5876c5-b3f7-4b42-b5f6-13fd36f2477d.png">

Right about this time, everybody, including me, was getting COVID, which was deeply un-fun, both for ourselves and for the ensemble. 0/10 do not recommend getting COVID, my voice is still a touch sensitive from it, and my range is gone, needs to be re-trained. 

Since people were missing class, you mentioned that it was important for some of us to learn other instruments' parts as well, so for juru pencar, the week that both Mike and Jeremy were out of class, I asked to learn their part on the rayong so that both halves of the interlocking happened, with Chen Hui playing the other half. This was probably the most fun piece for me on Gamelan, because it was difficult and loud. And adding the playing of kompang and putting it down then picking it up again was another level of challenge, so this one was absolutely a blast to play.

The last piece we learnt on Balinese Gamelan was Beleganjur, another processional piece. This one, was LOUD. I picked up the ceng ceng and just went to town on it. In the final performance however, the clear star player is Janice. When I showed the final performance videos to my parents, they only watched this piece over and over because Janice is just so fun to watch, and I think that's my biggest regret, that I was thinking too hard and not having this much fun. 


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13196618/164422821-568a82d6-0b15-4225-b7d4-5f3efebf9e91.mp4



Speaking of the final performance, you gave me the opportunity to emcee, again, but this time with an audience. This was one of the scary bits of the performance, because I've never actually done any emceeing before, and really wanted to make it engaging and interesting, do the job justice even if it isn't as important as the actual pieces. What if I forgot my script? What if they didn't think I was funny? I have no words for how much of a relief it was to hear a few laughs among the audience, because it meant I hadn't wildly miscalculated anything. Also preparing that script was when I found out that the final performance was like a bit of a farewell for you. Syaf pulled me aside and asked me to tell the group chat and organise something, and that something ended up being a card and flowers. 

Janice at this time had COVID and was stuck at home, bored, which resulted in this reaction:

<img width="883" alt="hotTea" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13196618/164423922-f1c04b62-6f4c-4479-9063-221ecab9f789.png">


And then she was incredibly eager to test negative and go out, and her hopes were dashed cruelly by the ART kit:

<img width="769" alt="mietteReference" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13196618/164413621-2368bddd-acf4-43a7-bcb5-4cd7578989ca.png">

(I would like to clarify that I was referencing the [miette meme](https://twitter.com/tricialockwood/status/1108102037072433153?lang=en), I do not actually talk like this)

She did eventually exit the naughty corner and I made her walk all over the mall to find a nice card for you :D

And here are the flowers I ordered and picked up, day of the final performance. I just had the don't be suspicious song ([here's the link, please watch it, you will not be disappointed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyEBeHvNJvE)) running on loop through my head the entire time, and I had a complete backstory and lies prepared to tell you about why I was showing up late to class on the day of the performance. Since I didn't get to fully use it, I will explain it here:
<img width="325" alt="dontBeSus" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13196618/164413667-1dc470bd-8e5f-485b-826c-fd7099e65d70.png">

  So I'm sitting at the cafe with my laptop open to look like I am working really hard, and if anyone asks I am memorizing my emcee script (which I had already done, I am far too anxious to be doing that day of), and the laptop is conveniently blocking the card and pens on the table, and I am texting people to come sign it, then once everybody is done I will turn up to class and say I was memorizing my script (which I did tell you)

It's been a long time since I've performed in front of an audience, and longer still since I've done it in a group. I guess the main thing I learnt is to know my own parts very well and know how it slots into the rest of the piece, because if I mess up I cannot adjust, since I need to follow the movement of everybody else. If just one person makes a mistake when everybody else is playing correctly, it's glaringly obvious. 

Another learning point is the importance of eye contact. Especially in Balinese Gamelan, with Rose doing the signalling on the drum, until you mentioned it and told us to look up, I never really did look up, too focused on staring at my instrument. She was truly giving us everything, entire paragraphs of instructions in body language alone. And like I said about the telepathy me and Jun Rong had in Juru Pencar, that eye contact was absolutely crucial to coordinating the parts together, because we were the only two people playing that part and we absolutely needed to get it right

And the last takeaway is the importance of sound quality. We spent the semester practicing in the carpeted, enclosed workshop and thinking we were rather loud. But it had nothing on how incredible the acoustics were in the foyer and on the way there, with the high ceilings and concrete and glass and metal. The building was SHAKING and the sounds filled my ears and it was such an incredible, unforgettable experience. The recording is great, almost but still nowhere near the experience of it in person.

Also, I really enjoyed rooting through your bag of stuff that you didn't need anymore, the [kazoo is an absolute goldmine of fun](https://youtu.be/AWXR5WEZ19g). Also the marbles make very pleasant clicking sounds, and they're very nice to hold and play with. Thanks for a fantastic final semester of uni, and best of luck for the future!
